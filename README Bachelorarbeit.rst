To recreate the experiments done in the bachelor's thesis run compute_smape.py in the evaluation folder.
It does take very long. (for tests choose Geolife dataset in config, and only const.Overview as analysis selection)

The datasets and tesselations can be found in a separate folder in the repository on gitlab.
